<p>Connect with your fellow hardware geeks and share some of the projects you’ve been working on!</p>

<p>More about the venue:</p>

<p>Hastings Library is on the corner of Orange Grove and Sierra Madre Villa near the Hastings Ranch area of Pasadena.  There is a parking lot, but there should also be plenty of street parking.</p>

<p>The meeting room is near the circulation desk.  There is a projector mounted overhead, but I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll be able to use it.</p>

<p>There are tables and chairs stacked in the corner.  We will need to set them up for the meeting and put them away before we leave.</p>

<p>The library offers free wifi.  Here are the instructions on how to connect:
<a href="http://cityofpasadena.net/library/services/wifi/">http://cityofpasadena.net/library/services/wifi/</a></p>

<p>If you want to work on projects, make sure you bring an extension cord and power strips. Be conscious that this is a library, so let&#8217;s not  do anything that may upset the library staff or cause the patrons to complain.</p>

    <id>http://sgvhak.github.com/2012/09/20/raspberry-pi-etc-sig</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>If you are interested in the group, please sign up for the <a href="http://sgvhak.net/mailman/listinfo/hak" title="SGVHAK Mailing List Sign Up">SGVHAK mailing list</a>. We will continue to crosspost announcements to the SGVLUG mailing list. We are in the process of setting up a website or subpage.</em></p>

<p>Do you like working on hardware projects?  Did you just get a Raspberry Pi/Arduino/Kinect with the intentions of doing something cool?  Did you wish that there was a local meetup group where you can meet up with like-minded folks and actually make progress with your projects?</p>

<p>Come to our kickoff meeting on Thursday to discuss starting up this special interest group.  Connect with your fellow hardware geeks and share some of the projects you&#8217;ve been working on. And if we can decide on a name for the SIG, we can set up things like a mailing list, website, and wiki.</p>

<p>We have been kindly granted access to a room at Caltech for this meeting only.  It is a small classroom with about 30 student desks and a teacher desk.  We will have access to a projector and power.  There is an open wireless network.</p>

<p>Date: Thursday, September 20, 2012 @ 7 pm <br/>
Location: Caltech - Downs 119</p>
