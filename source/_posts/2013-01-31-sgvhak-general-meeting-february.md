__When__: Thursday, 02/07/2013 6:45 - 8:45 PM<br />
__Where__: [Hastings Branch Library](http://cityofpasadena.net/library/about_the_library/hastings_branch/) (3325 East Orange Grove Boulevard  Pasadena, CA 91107)

Come find us at the meeting room near the circulation desk.

These are hands-on working meetings. There are tables, free wifi, and a group of knowledgeable people. So come, bring your projects, show off your new toys, and just connect with your fellow hardware geeks. There is even a projector if you want to do a mini-presentation.

This month, there is some video to show off and topics to discuss, but only the interested parties need to tune in.

* Video of the machining of the Raspberry Pi case (taken during Tux Labs tour.  Also captures the conversation I had with Scoops.  Whoops.)
* Hackerspace wishlist 
* Deezmaker meetup
* SGVHAK T-shirts for members and promotional items as giveaways
* SGVHAK BoF at the [Southern California Linux Expo](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x)


*** Remember to bring extension cords and power strips. Multimeters and tools are nice. ***
