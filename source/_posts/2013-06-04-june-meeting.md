Come find us at the meeting room near the circulation desk.

These are hands-on working meetings. There are tables, free wifi, and a group of knowledgeable people. So come, bring your projects, show off your new toys, and just connect with your fellow hardware geeks. There is even a projector if you want to do a mini-presentation.

This month:

* Future meeting plans -- we were unable to reserve room for same timeslot
* Hackerspace discussion followup -- results of the survey and other things

*** Remember to bring extension cords and power strips. Multimeters and tools are nice. ***
