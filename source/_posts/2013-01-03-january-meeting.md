__When__: Thursday, 01/03/2013 6:45 - 8:45 PM<br />
__Where__: [Hastings Branch Library](http://cityofpasadena.net/library/about_the_library/hastings_branch/) (3325 East Orange Grove Boulevard  Pasadena, CA 91107)

Come find us at the meeting room near the circulation desk.

These are hands-on working meetings.  There are tables, [free wifi](http://cityofpasadena.net/library/services/wifi/), and a group of knowledgeable people.  So come, bring your projects, show off yoru new toys, and just connect with your fellow hardware geeks.  There is even a projector if you want to do a mini-presentation.

Remember to bring extension cords and power strips.  Multimeters and tools are nice.  The jury is still out on soldering irons.
