__Where__: [Hastings Branch Library](http://cityofpasadena.net/library/about_the_library/hastings_branch/) (3325 East Orange Grove Boulevard  Pasadena, CA 91107)

Come find us at the meeting room near the circulation desk.

These are hands-on working meetings. There are tables, free wifi, and a group of knowledgeable people. So come, bring your projects, show off your new toys, and just connect with your fellow hardware geeks. There is even a projector if you want to do a mini-presentation.

This month:

* Braddock will be bringing in some of his Internet-in-a-Box prototypes to HAK on.

*** Remember to bring extension cords and power strips. Multimeters and tools are nice. ***
